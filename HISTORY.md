# Release 0.1 (04/21/2020)

First release of kimmy, a package for exploring galactic chemical evolution in python.

Currently implements only a simple one-zone chemical model with two elements O (for oxygen) and Fe (for iron). You can compute the track in [O/Fe] vs. [Fe/H] for this model, as well as the metallicity distribution (of any element, [Fe/H], [O/H], or [O/Fe]).
